    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the properties of both Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) and Lasso Regression (L1 regularization). It introduces two regularization parameters, alpha and lambda, to control the balance between L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression differs from other regression techniques in the following ways:\n",
    "- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression: No regularization is applied, which can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- Ridge Regression: Uses only L2 regularization, which can handle multicollinearity but does not perform feature selection.\n",
    "- Lasso Regression: Uses only L1 regularization, which performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero but may struggle when features are highly correlated.\n",
    "- Elastic Net Regression: Combines both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a more flexible approach that can handle correlated features and perform feature selection.\n"
